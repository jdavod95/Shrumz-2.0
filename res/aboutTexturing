How to put in new textures:
	- files have to be the content of the "textures" folder
	- "raw" folders are ignored
	- file's extension has to be .png - yet
	- file's width and height has to be the powers of 2 (ex.: 128 * 256)
	- naming conventions:
		- case insensitive
		- there is a name and a number part of the file name,
			divided by a '_' character
		- after the last '_' comes the size of a single frame in the file
		- ex.: "Shrum_64.png"
		- the texture's name is "SHRUM" 
			and a single frame in the file is 64 * 64 in size
